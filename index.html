    <h1>Cardboard Drum Set</h1>

    <p>By: Danny, Conrad, Joseph</p>


    <!-- Here I surrouned my js sketch with the id div talk. Again I call it portrait in my sketch.js, so it's portrait here -->

      Here this is where you can provide a short description to the project.
      Possibly an introduction, an overview, and instructions on how to
      manipulate the project.

    <p>
      Then you can provide more context if needed. Consider this an opportunity
      to host documentation and images of your project throughout it's
      development. If you have a paper portion, then you can be very brief here
      and save the content for your essay.
